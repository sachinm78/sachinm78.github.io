While I have always been tech savvy and interested in learning more about web development and computer programming, I’ve only had limited experience working with HTML to create basic web layouts back when I was in college at Loyola University Chicago.  Technology has come a long way since I graduated, but I’ve done my best to keep up with the trends.  As a daily user of the internet, I know a few tricks, but I consider myself a knowledgeable amateur when it comes to understanding and writing computer code.

While coding always seemed accessible, it wasn’t until my most recent job that I considered making a major career change.  I worked for a company called TinkRworks, LLC located in the west suburbs of Chicago, IL.  They provide after-school enrichment to elementary and middle school students in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM).  I served as the director of the after-school education department where I managed the teachers, developed curriculum and lesson materials, taught classes, and managed the teaching staff.  Here, I learned to use 21st century design and fabrication technology like computer-aided design (CAD), 3D printing, laser-cutting and much more.  I also learned how to build and code DIY robots, drones and interactive artwork.  It was definitely an interesting and exciting place to work.

The list of new skills I learned in my 2 and-a-half years at TinkRworks is extensive, but the one I’m most grateful for is the deeper introduction into the world of development and code.  My first exposure was through an online block coding program called Scratch.  It was developed by a team of educators at MIT to help make coding more accessible to young learners.  Using simple to learn coding blocks, Scratch allows you to create games, apps and animated stories.  It was definitely one of my favorite programs to teach.

As head of the education team, I worked very closely with our dev team on what our coding apps and student interfaces should look like.  It was in these meetings and in my daily interactions with the developers that I truly became inspired to learn more about what they do.  I watched as they designed custom lightsabers fitted with programmable LEDs that could be coded simply with custom coding blocks created by our team.  My job was to make the code as accessible as possible for students.  But in the process, I found myself intrigued and inspired to learn more.  

But changing careers is not so simple.  In fact, it can be stressful and terrifying.  This was not my first major career change, however, so I had an idea of the challenges that would lie ahead.  It was in 2007 that I quit a promising career in banking to become a certified teacher.  By 2008, I was teaching English on a small Island in South Korea called Jeju Island.  Little did I know that I would call Jeju my home for almost a decade.  
The experiences I had living and teaching abroad were life-changing.  I even met my wife along the way on that very same little South Korean island.

Thankfully, my current career change is not nearly as difficult to achieve.  I am grateful that I had the support of my wife and my family and friends to make this change a possibility.  And it was a friend that I met in my teachings in Korea that helped inspire me to check out Flatiron school.  

So here I am, 1 month into the online web development program and I can say that I am very happy with my decision thus far.  The first few weeks have been stressful at times.  As a teacher, I know that learning new languages can be difficult.  Code is no different.  I have found myself stuck at times, feeling lost, but that feeling subsides with each passing week.  Each lesson I learn builds on the last.  Each concept becomes easier to grasp as I am exposed to it further.  Coding is by no means easy, but I am very happy with the lessons and support provided by Flatiron School.  

Changing careers is not for everyone.  But if you are considering a major career change, you could do a lot worse than a job in web development.  It’s a booming market and developers are in high-demand around the world.  I don’t know where this journey will eventually lead me, but I’m definitely excited at all the new possibilities that await!
