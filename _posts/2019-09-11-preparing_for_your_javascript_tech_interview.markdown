You did it!  You're a bootcamp graduate.  Congratulations!  You must be feeling pretty good right about now.  And you should be.  It's a great accomplishment to learn to navigate so much complexity in so little time.  Part one of your transformative journey is complete.  Now you're ready for the next hurdle: the job search.

If you're anything like me, you feel more confident than you did when you started this process.  You've come a long way in a short period of time.  Like me, you may have continued to study and learn since you completed your program.  It's been great to add a little more depth to your understanding of certain concepts that may have been difficult to grasp at first.  And it's even better to be able to pick up something new, whether it's a framework your program didn't quite cover or an entirely new language that's in-demand or interesting to you.  

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows in my world these days.  At the end of the day, it still seems like there is so much more to learn and no possible way to absorb all the information available out there.  And in all honesty, all that confidence seems to go right out the door the second someone asks me a technical question I'm not certain how to answer or even worse, asks me something I've never seen or learned before.

I recently had my first experience with the dreaded technical interview a few weeks ago.  This one was practice as part of the career services curriculum included with my program.  Even so, I was nervous leading up to it.  I did my best to brush up on the fundamentals and key concepts in JavaScript.  I wanted to make the most of this opportunity to test my knowledge.  

It went well, better than I had expected.  The interviewer was a big part of that.  He was patient, helpful, supportive and gave me excellent feedback on where I did well and where I needed to improve my knowledge.  And it was a pleasant surprise to me, but I really enjoyed the process.  But that may not be the case in the real world.  In fact, there are plenty of horror stories out there and I'm sure most of us have heard our share of them.  

But fear not.  There are plenty of resources available that will help you prepare for the real deal.  In part 1 of this post, I will list out some that I found helpful and others that I use to practice technical questions.  In next week’s [follow up post](http://crackingthecode.net/preparing_for_your_javascript_tech_interview_part_2), I’ll list some key concepts you should know before your JS tech interview with resources to help you strengthen your knowledge and confidence.  

*Practice Makes Perfect*

## Resources

Practice may not make you perfect when it comes to solving difficult technical interview questions, but it definitely can’t hurt.  Here are some great places to try real technical interview questions for free:

* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)
* [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/en/)
* [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/customer/free-user)

I haven't tried all of these sites personally, but I've enjoyed and learned quite a bit from the time I have spent practicing on them thus far.  And if the formats above are not your cup of tea, here are a few places to watch or read to help prepare for your next technical interview:

* [Answering Tricky JS Interview Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY0UBGX2FtA): This video covers a few concepts in a way that I found easy to follow.

* [Some JS Interview Questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions) on Toptal.com: Unlike the interactive sites above, here is a list with questions and solutions you can practice and review.

* [30 Seconds of Code](https://30secondsofknowledge.com/): This extension for Chrome or Firefox gives you a random code snippet each time you open a new tab.  Topics include React, Ruby, Python, Interview Questions, and much more.  You can even save the snippets you like so you can read them later.

I have barely skimmed the surface on all the wonderful resources that are available to help ease some of the nerves that come with having to complete technical interviews.  But I hope the above links will prove to be as helpful to you as they have to me thus far.

In [part 2](http://crackingthecode.net/preparing_for_your_javascript_tech_interview_part_2) of this topic, I will take a step back and go over some of the fundamentals of JS every programmer should review before their next tech interview.  Until then, happy coding!
