One of the challenges I’ve noticed since graduating from Flatiron is that it can be easy to get complacent.  After all, I’ve come a long way in a short period of time and overcome countless challenges and obstacles along the way.  I’m not wasting my days away by any means.  I’m actively in the job hunt, networking with anyone and everyone I can think of, applying to positions I feel are a good fit, and researching companies that I might like to work for.  But in all the focus on finding that first dev job, it’s important not to forget to keep learning code.  After all, there is so much more to learn.  Flatiron gave us a solid foundation on which to build, and I truly encourage you to keep building, dear reader.

On that note, I thought I would share some of the best places I’ve found to continue learning code for free.  Before we get started, let me just get a few things out of the way.  It goes without saying that there are countless places to learn coding, from tutorials, to step-by-step tech blogs, to Youtube videos.  If you’ve found something you like that’s easy to follow, by all means, use it.  But if you’re like me, you can never have enough resources at your disposal.  Also, I am not affiliated with any of the sites I’m listing and they will not be paying me in any way.  This is just my opinion and my personal experience.  With that out of the way, let’s get to it.

For the sake of keeping this post manageable, here are the 3 sites I’ve found myself using most often since I graduated:

## [Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/)

One of my cohort members shared this site with me while we were still finishing up.  It wasn’t until after graduation that I gave it a try.  And I’m so glad that I did.  Here’s why: Scrimba keeps their lessons simple AND their platform allows you to pause the video at any point and click on the code to edit and play with it live.  That’s right, they turned their coding video lesson into a virtual sandbox code editor!

Before Flatiron, I spent many years in education.  As a seasoned teacher, I can’t emphasise this enough: the best way to learn is through trying it out yourself.  When it comes to code, that can be hard to do since even the simplest projects can quickly become complex, especially when the code being used is unfamiliar.  With Scrimba, you get the best of both worlds: the step-by-step tutorials with one of the most convenient and clever uses of the sandbox code editor I’ve seen out there.  

Scrimba offers lots of free courses you can try out, from the familiar **CSS3**, **HTML5**, and **React** lessons to some that Flatiron didn’t cover, like **Angular**, **Vue** and **React Hooks**.  I tried Scrimba’s React lessons and found them to be very easy to follow.  Now that might be because I had already been studying React with Flatiron, but I just felt their lessons were presented in a manner that made it easier for me to grasp all that’s in play in React.  I also tried their CSS lessons and quickly learned to style like a pro.  I liked it so much in fact that I purchased their lessons on Responsive Design.  It really is a great platform to learn.  You can check out a video tutorial [here](https://scrimba.com/c/c8gp4WfE): 

## [Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

You’re probably already familiar with this amazing site.  If not, you should definitely check it out.  They have lots of great lessons to help you hone your current skills and learn some new ones as well.  And now that you have the foundation through Flatiron, picking up new skills will be far easier than before.  

While I haven’t really tried too many of their lessons, I did sign up and join their mailing list.  Each week, I receive an email digest with an amazing list of resources to help me keep learning.  I actually signed up for them when I first started studying at Flatiron.  I will admit that I didn’t really read them much during my bootcamp program, but now that I have some more time and no structured lessons, I’ve been relying on this weekly email heavily to guide me as I continue to learn new tricks.  Here is this week’s email in its entirety as an example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Here are this week's five links that are worth your time:*

*1. [Learn data structures from a Google engineer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-data-structures-from-a-google-engineer/). This free beginner-friendly course will teach you common data structures like singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, binary trees, hash tables, AVL trees, and more. (8 hour video course + code examples)*

*2. [How to code your own Random Meal Generator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-random-meal-generator/). Your web app will give you a random recipe and cooking tutorial video whenever you're hungry, but don't know what to cook. (7 minute read with code samples and a working demo)*

*3. [How to learn constantly without burning out](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-constantly-learn-without-burning-out/) (6 minute read)*

*4. [How to use productivity apps to organize your digital life](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/productivity/), and get more done in less time (11 minute read)*

*5. [Lessons learned during Lekha's first year as a software engineer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/my-first-year-as-a-software-engineer/). She shares insights on what to expect, and also some tips for women getting into tech (7 minute read)*

*Quote of the Week: "The value of a prototype is in the education it gives you, not in the code itself." - Alan Cooper*

*How is it possible that [freeCodeCamp.org](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) can help millions of people learn to code for free? It's all thanks to thoughtful people like you. Help us help even more people. Make a tax deductible donation today*

*Happy coding.*

## [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)

When you’re looking for a quick reference on things like which form tag to use or how to style something with **CSS**, W3Schools will often come up as one of the top Google search results.  There’s a good reason for that.  Their materials are simple and concise.  They also provide sample code and a sandbox to try it out in.  It’s not fully interactive like [Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/), but it’s still pretty useful.  I’ve used this site throughout my time at Flatiron, especially when I needed some CSS help.  Since graduating, I went through their materials on **PHP** and found it to be both easy to follow and quick to pick up.  That’s partly because I’m building off of what Flatiron has already taught me, but I really like the simple quizzes at the end of each section to help test and reinforce your learning.

That concludes this short list of free sites I like to use.  I hope it’s been helpful.  I’ll be back next week with more.  Until then, happy coding!
