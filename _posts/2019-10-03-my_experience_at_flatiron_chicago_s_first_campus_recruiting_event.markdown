This week, I was one of the lucky Chicago area graduates that was invited to attend the first Campus Recruiting Event at Flatiron School’s Chicago campus.  In this post, I’ll tell you about my experience and offer some key advice that will help you prepare for life after graduation.  I hope that other graduates or students working their way towards completing their programs will find this post informative.

Before I go over the event, let’s cover some of the background.  It’s my understanding that Flatiron hosts these kinds of events at their campus locations to match graduates with prospective employers.  The campus in Chicago is fairly new.  I believe it opened in 2018.  The group of students attending this first event were some of the first graduates from either the Chicago Campus Immersive programs or like me, an online graduate that lives in the Chicago area.  To qualify for this event, we had to be graduates AND we had to have completed most of the career track requirements prior to the deadline to qualify for the event.  We were given plenty of notice about the upcoming event and the eligibility requirements, and we were also encouraged to work with our career coach to ensure we would be able to attend.  We were not required to have declared our job search starting date yet.  


## Leading Up To The Fair Dates: 

Chicago’s first Career Fair was held over two afternoons on Monday, Sept. 30th and Tuesday, Oct. 1st.  We were required to available for the full time on both days.  As we were getting closer to the fair dates, we received an email letting us know about a live Zoom Q&A session where we could ask any questions we may have about the upcoming event.  This was held on a Thursday afternoon, the week before the fair.  It was a good chance for participants to get some important logistical information.  We were also assured we would receive specific information on the companies we had been matched with by the end of the day Friday, giving us the weekend to prepare for the fair.  The Employee Partners team used our resume on Learn and our answers to the career survey we completed soon after graduating to help match us to prospective employers.

I spent a few hours over the weekend researching each company, preparing myself to talk about my skills and experience, and thinking of questions I might have for the interviewers.  It was a lot of work, but well worth the effort to feel prepared and more confident.  The career services curriculum was very helpful in this regard as well.  

## The Career Fair:

I was one of 9 participants in attendance for this fair.  Each of us was matched with 3 or 4 companies.  The Employee Partners team in Chicago did their best to keep it even and to try to match us up with companies we would like to work for.  There were 5 companies in attendance over the two-days.  Below are the four that I met with.  Click on the company name to visit their sites and learn more:

[Home Chef:](https://www.homechef.com/) local start-up meal delivery service that recently was bought out by Krogers for $700M

[Next Capital:](https://nextcapital.com/#/) provides investment advice through a digital platform

[National Democratic Training Committee:](https://traindemocrats.org/) non-profit that helps prospective progressive candidates who want to run for local office

[G2:](https://www.g2.com/) provides B2B reviews on software and technology

I met with each employer for around 30 minutes.  We were told to prepare for anything, including technical style interviews and whiteboarding.  I am happy to report that in all four cases, the employers were looking for cultural fits.  In fact, all four of my interview experiences were quite pleasant.  We reviewed my qualifications, my final project and went over the job offer and hiring process.  There were some technical questions of course, but nothing that was very difficult.  In the case of each company, if they liked what they heard, then they would advance you to the next stage in the process.  In most cases, this means some form of technical assessment, either online, over video, or in person.  

I won’t go into specific details about each company or each interview.  But I do want to leave you with some helpful advice.  

**Stay on top of your career service track requirements:** There are a lot of meetings with your coach and practice interviews you need to complete before you can be considered for a campus recruiting event.

**Upload your resume to your Learn Profile:** Once you and your coach have reviewed and approved your resume, upload it to Learn.  The Career Services and Employee Partner Teams at Flatiron will use that resume to find you potential job matches.  

**Use the Career Services Track materials:** I had completed this material soon after graduating, but I went back and reviewed a few key sections before the event.  While a lot of the advice given in this track may seem like it’s obvious, it’s well worth the time to read it.  

**Start your Career Tracker:** If you want to be eligible for Flatiron School’s money back guarantee, you will need to meet certain requirements each week.  I declared my job search date 3 weeks before the fair so I was able to meet all of the networking requirements for the week with ease. 

**Use your Career Coach:** They are there to help you in this process.  Be sure to schedule time with them!

**Network with other attendees:** I was very fortunate to be at this event with 8 other graduates who were kind, supportive and willing to share information with each other so we knew what to expect before going into the interview room.  We connected on LinkedIn and shared advice.  And don’t be shy to ask your interviewers if you can connect on LinkedIn.  I actually had two of them offer to connect without me asking.  

**Write thoughtful thank you notes:** With many qualified candidates up for the same positions, a well-crafted thank you could make all the difference.  The Career prep materials have great tips to help you write excellent letters.  And don’t forget to thank the organizers.  They put in a ton of work.

That sums up my experience and advice after the first Chicago campus Recruiting event.  I hope this information will prove helpful.  I will be back next week and shifting gears from career advice to good old Ruby.  Until then, happy coding!
